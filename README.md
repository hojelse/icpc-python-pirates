This repo hosts the Team Reference Document of $\sim$ Python Pirates from ITU. The PDF [icpc_python_pirates.pdf](./icpc_python_pirates.pdf) consists of 25 pages of succinct python code, mathematics, etc., for aid in ICPC-style programming competitions.

## Development
For editing the tex file, overleaf can be used. Use the "Menu" > "GitHub" > "Github sync" page to push and pull changes. [Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/project/63768d6deb5b7e2237cbb20c).

A new version of the PDF should *occationally* be pushed to the repo for convenience.

Add code to the code/ directory.

Code formatting and requirements (Maybe there should be added a linter)
- Lines should no wider than 64 characters.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Code should be succinct and quick to type out.
- Algorithms should be *fast enough* as to not suffer in succinctness.
